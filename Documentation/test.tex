\begin{abstract}
We are creating a GAN model and using social media data to find anoamlies in the stock market. We are focusing on Indian stocks.

\section{Introduction to all the modules used}
\subsection{GAN Modules}
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{haweslib}: This is to generate the values from the stock data. We are taking buy and sell orders and performing hawkes process on them to generate probaility values. These values are then used to generate images.
\item \underline{PIL:} This is used to generate images from the values generated by haweslib.
\item \underline{The GAN Module:} This is the actual GAN module. It takes the images generated by PIL and trains the GAN model on them.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Front End Technologies}
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{HTML:} This is used to create the basic front end of the website.
\item \underline{Jinja 2.0:} This is a way to extend the functionality of HTML. We are using it to create the dynamic front end of the website.
\item \underline{CSS:} This is used to style the website.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Middle and Back End Technologies}
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Flask:} This is used to create the server side of the website. This will render the Jinja templates and also create all the linking between the front end and the database.
\item \underline{Some SQL thing:} This is used to create the database for the website.
\end{itemize}
\section{All modules that were tested and discarded}
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{streamlit:} This was used to create the front end of the website. It was discarded because it was not flexible enough.
\item \underline{pyhawkes:} This was an alternative to haweslib. It was not used as hawkeslib proved to be enough.
\end{itemize}
